# Solutions to the lab exercises for COMP0088 Introduction to Machine Learning

Scripts here provide example implementations for the exercises in the directory above. These are intended to be *illustrative* rather than *definitive*. In general, there is not "one true way" to solve the lab exercises -- if you did it another way, that's great!

**Solutions will be posted on the Monday following the lab.**
